## Important Notes

- This is just a proof of concept project on how to create React Native app using TypeScript. I do NOT endorse or condone, in any shape or form, automating any monitoring or booking tasks. <b>Use at your own risk</b>.
This CANNOT book slots automatically. It doesn't skip any of the steps that a normal user would have to take on the official portal. You will still have to enter the OTP and Captcha.
- If you want to use Pincode filter, it is mandatory to select State and District including the pincode.
- All the beneficiaries you select are supposed to get the same vaccine and dose.
- You can not register new mobile or add beneficiaries using this app. Please make sure beneficiary has been added to your cowin account before using the app.
